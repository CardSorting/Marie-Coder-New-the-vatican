# Contributing to MarieCoder 🌸

Thank you for your interest in making MarieCoder even more joyful! We welcome contributions that align with our core philosophy of **intentionality, clarity, and gratitude**.

## 🌟 The Contributor's Mindset

1. **Ask "Why?"**: Before submitting a PR, ensure the change is necessary. Does it spark joy? Does it simplify the code?
2. **Atomic Changes**: Keep your PRs small and focused. One PR per intention.
3. **Gratitude**: When refactoring, honor the existing code's service. We improve with respect, not criticism.

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. **Fork & Branch**: Create a descriptive branch (e.g., `feature/joyful-status-bar`).
2. **Follow Standards**: Adhere to the [KonMari Standards](konmari-standards.md) and [Joy Zoning Protocol](../JOY_ZONING.md).
3. **Test Mindfully**: Ensure your changes don't introduce clutter or break the Downward Flow Law.
4. **Joyful Commits**: Use our commit message pattern: `[Type]: [Summary] [Emoji]`.
   - *Example*: `Feature: Implement breath-work animation 🌬️`

## 🧹 Code Quality

- **No Clutter**: Do not leave commented-out code. Trust version control.
- **Strict Typing**: Avoid `any` at all costs. Every type should be intentional.
- **Snake Case Files**: All non-component files must follow `snake_case`.

## 🤝 Community

We are building a compassionate community of developers. Be kind, be patient, and help others find joy in their work.
