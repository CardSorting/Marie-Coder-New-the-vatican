# Agent Stream Control Plane (Scaffolding)

This document describes the newly added **control-plane/data-plane scaffolding** for moving from shared swarm streams to **on-demand isolated agent streams**.

## Why this was added

The current swarm architecture has strong agent specialization, but turn execution and stream lifecycle are still mostly centralized. This scaffolding introduces the primitives needed to safely evolve into per-agent token streams with deterministic merge behavior.

## New components

### 1) Contracts
- `src/infrastructure/ai/core/AgentStreamContracts.ts`
- Defines:
  - `AgentIntentClass`
  - `AgentIntentRequest`
  - `SpawnPlan`
  - `AgentEnvelope`
  - `AgentTurnContext`

### 2) Policy Engine
- `src/infrastructure/ai/core/AgentStreamPolicyEngine.ts`
- Computes spawn score and admission decisions using configurable thresholds.

### 3) Intent Scheduler
- `src/infrastructure/ai/core/AgentIntentScheduler.ts`
- Produces deterministic spawn plans from turn context + intent requests.

### 4) Stream Manager
- `src/infrastructure/ai/core/AgentStreamManager.ts`
- Tracks active isolated stream handles, timeouts, cancellation, and lifecycle state.

### 5) Merge Arbiter
- `src/infrastructure/ai/core/AgentMergeArbiter.ts`
- Single-writer staging + deterministic acceptance/rejection ordering for agent envelopes.

## Event model additions

`src/domain/marie/MarieTypes.ts` now includes:
- `StreamIdentity`
- `agent_stream_lifecycle` event
- `agent_envelope` event

These are backward-compatible additions for future multi-stream event routing.

## Config flags added

In `ConfigService`:
- `isAgentStreamsEnabled()`
- `getAgentStreamMaxConcurrent()`
- `getAgentStreamSpawnThreshold()`
- `getAgentStreamTimeoutMs()`
- `getAgentStreamPilotAgents()`

Defaults are conservative and safe.

## Recent hardening upgrades

- Deterministic scheduler sequencing now uses run-scoped sequence IDs (`agent_<runId>_<agent>_<sequence>`).
- Admission now distinguishes:
  - `policyAccepted` (would pass policy)
  - `executionAccepted` (actually eligible to spawn in current mode)
  - `executionReason` (deterministic explanation for admission/suppression)
- SHADOW mode preserves policy observability while preventing execution.
- Stream manager enforces max-concurrency guardrails and propagates standardized terminal reasons (`timeout`, `manual_cancel`, `engine_dispose`, `pressure_shed`).
- Arbiter now applies deterministic conflict handling with intent priority and blocking-condition dominance.
- QASRE pilot path emits incremental stream telemetry and records stream provenance (`streamId`) into blackboard envelope memory.
- Added per-turn spawn budget control: `getAgentStreamMaxSpawnsPerTurn()`.
- Added pressure-shedding switch: `isAgentStreamPressureSheddingEnabled()`.
- Engine now sheds non-critical active streams under HIGH pressure before planning new spawns.
- Scheduler now suppresses non-allowlisted intents under HIGH pressure and reports explicit suppression reasons.
- Stream manager terminal-state cache is now bounded to avoid unbounded growth in long-running sessions.

## Engine integration (non-invasive)

`MarieEngine` now initializes and runs a **preview-only control-plane pass** each turn:
- Builds intent requests (currently QASRE + ISO9001 examples)
- Runs scheduler + policy
- Stages preview envelopes through arbiter
- Emits a reasoning telemetry line with accepted/rejected counts

Important: this integration does **not** alter existing swarm behavior or tool execution flow.

## Rollout guidance

1. Keep `agentStreamsEnabled=false` (shadow mode behavior).
2. Validate telemetry quality and policy scores.
3. Enable `agentStreamPilotAgents` for one pilot (e.g. `QASRE`) and validate isolated streaming telemetry.
4. Gate merges via arbiter commit policy.
5. Expand to additional agents gradually.

## Stage-gate checklist (recommended)

1. **Shadow confidence gate**
   - Track `policyAccepted` vs `executionAccepted` divergence.
   - Verify deterministic stream IDs and stable scheduler ordering in repeated runs.
2. **Pilot safety gate**
   - Enable only `QASRE` in `agentStreamPilotAgents`.
   - Keep low `agentStreamMaxSpawnsPerTurn` while validating telemetry and timeout behavior.
3. **Load/pressure gate**
   - Simulate HIGH pressure and verify pressure shedding only cancels non-critical intents.
4. **Expansion gate**
   - Add one agent at a time; keep rollback path by toggling `agentStreamsEnabled=false`.
