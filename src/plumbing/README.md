# The Mechanical Underworld: Plumbing Zone 🔧

> "Respect the pipes, but never romanticize the grease. The Underworld ensures that the kinetic energy of execution flows without friction."

The **Plumbing Zone** is the gritty, mechanical layer of the world. It provides the raw primitives—filesystem I/O, shell execution, and git wrappers—that Marie uses to manifest her will in the physical repo.

### Nature of the Underworld
- **Machinery**: Logic here is low-level and mechanical.
- **Containment**: It is respected, but isolated. No domain knowledge or opinionated logic is allowed to seep back into these pipes.
- **Durable**: This is the plumbing that keeps the garden watered. It must be reliable, replaceable, and boring.

### Primitives
- **BaseTool.ts**: The universal interface for mechanical action.
- **Filesystem Wrappers**: Safely interacting with the host OS.
