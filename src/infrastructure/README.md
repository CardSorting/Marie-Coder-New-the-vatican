# The Strategic Forge: Infrastructure Zone 🏗️

> "Stability is the bedrock of sovereignty. The Forge ensures that while the spirit of the system remains high, the mechanics remain iron-clad and calm."

The **Infrastructure Zone** is where Marie's spirit is tempered into stability. It absorbs the complexity of the outside world—AI providers, secret keys, and state bridges—so that the **Sanctum of Intent** remains undisturbed.

### Laws of the Forge
1. **Termination**: Complexity must stop here. It shall not leak abstractions upward.
2. **Replaceability**: Every adapter, every provider, and every registry must be swappable without touching the heart of the system.
3. **Emotional Flatness**: While the Domain is expressive, Infrastructure is mechanical and heavy. It exists so joyful code doesn't have to care.

### Key Projects
- **AI Core**: Managing the heavy reasoning loops and ascension protocols.
- **Config Services**: Anchoring Marie to her environment without polluting her intent.
- **Adapters**: The bridge between Marie's will and the tools she wields.

*Stability is not a goal—it is a requirement for freedom.*
