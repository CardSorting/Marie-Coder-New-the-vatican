# The Sanctum of Intent: Domain Zone ✨

> "In the heart of the Vatican, only the purest forms reside. This is where we define what is true, before we care about how it is executed."

The **Domain Zone** is the sacred garden of Marie's soul. It is protected by the [Joy Zoning Protocol](../../JOY_ZONING.md) from the conceptual backflow of infrastructure and plumbing. 

### Principles of the Sanctum
1. **Purity**: No adapters, no glue, and no environment-aware logic.
2. **Expression**: Code here must be readable and intentional. It is the reason the system exists.
3. **Sovereignty**: The Domain layer dictates the shape of the world. All other layers must bend to its definitions.

### Current Inhabitants:
- `DomainEntity.ts`: The foundational blueprint of our shared reality.
