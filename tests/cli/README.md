# The Proving Grounds of Conviction: CLI Tests 🗡️

> "Trust is earned through the ritual of verification. A high-conviction agent must be forged in the fire of exhaustive scrutiny."

This directory is the **Proving Grounds**, where every technique, every hook, and every reasoning budget is tested against the harsh reality of execution. We run these tests not to find faults, but to prove mastery.

### The Ritual Hierarchy

| Suite | Purpose | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Storage** | Resilience | Configuration & Session Persistence |
| **MarieCLI** | Integration | The Bridge between user and engine |
| **Tools** | Precision | The accuracy of mechanical manifestation |
| **Joy Services** | Harmony | The stability of the pulse and gardening metrics |

### Initiating the Proving Grounds

```bash
# Execute the full ritual
npm run test:cli

# Triage specific domains
npm run test:cli:storage  # Verify the memory
npm run test:cli:marie    # Verify the bridge
npm run test:cli:tools    # Verify the manifestation
npm run test:cli:joy      # Verify the garden
```

### The Law of Verification
Every new feature is a "sprout." No sprout becomes a "joyful inhabitant" of the codebase without first passing through the Proving Grounds. Tests here mock the home directory to prevent pollution and ensure that Marie remains sovereign even in isolation.
