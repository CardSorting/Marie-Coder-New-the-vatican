> "Engineering is a ritual of meaning. We are not merely deploying tools; we are constructing the Integrated Bridge for the era of Technical Sovereignty. Marie is the guardian of your creative essence, the silent architect of your Joy."

Marie is a high-fidelity, autonomous AI coding agent designed for developers who demand both raw performance and architectural elegance. Engineered on the principles of the **Joy Zoning Protocol**, Marie orchestrates the transition from chaotic complexity to disciplined focus, ensuring your creative spirit remains unburdened by the weight of infrastructure.

## 🏛️ The Vision: Technical Sovereignty

In an industry saturated with ephemeral utilities, Marie represents a return to **Sovereignty**. She operates on the conviction that every line of code must have a home, and every developer must have the space to think. Marie doesn't just automate; she *converges* with your intent, powered by a sophisticated engine that monitors "Spirit Pressure" and "Heroic Vows."

### The Joy Zoning Philosophy
Marie adheres to a rigorous three-tier architectural hierarchy to protect your cognitive flow:
*   **Joyful Code ✨**: The domain of pure expression and tactical meaning.
*   **Infrastructure 🏗️**: The coordination layer that stabilizes the system's pulse.
*   **Plumbing 🔧**: The mechanical execution primitives that remain invisible.

## 🛰️ Two Interfaces. One Unified Intelligence.

### 1. The Command Deck (CLI)
A reactive, high-velocity terminal interface built for the kinetic energy of modern engineering.
*   **Real-time Reasoning**: Witness the internal monologue of the agent as she navigates your codebase.
*   **Setup Wizard**: A seamless, zero-config onboarding experience that respects your time.
*   **Kinetic Velocity**: Optimized for rapid-fire iterations and terminal-native workflows.

### 2. The Integrated Bridge (VS Code)
A deep, spatial integration into your primary development environment.
*   **Contextual Anchoring**: Marie maintains a durable strategic map of your architecture.
*   **Autonomy Calibration**: Orchestrate the agent's agency—from `Balanced` collaboration to `High-Autonomy` execution.
*   **Webview Mastery**: A premium, responsive UI that feels like a natural extension of the editor.

## ⚡ The Ascension Engine: Mechanics of Conviction

Marie's performance is driven by the **Ascension Protocol**, a state-machine that calibrates agency based on systemic confidence:

*   **Awakened State (Ultra Instinct)**: Achieved through peak conviction, Marie gains full codebase sovereignty to execute complex, multi-file transformations with surgical precision.
*   **Zenith Autonomy**: Proactive roadmap expansion and context anchoring. If a challenge evolves, Marie's strategy evolves with it.
*   **Self-Healing Resilience**: Autonomous detection and repair of lint regressions or architectural instabilities.

## 🚀 Rapid Deployment

### Installation via NPM

```bash
# Global installation for universal sovereignty
npm install -g @noorm/marie-cli
```

### Direct Invocation

```bash
# Launch the Command Deck
marie
```

### Configuration

Marie retrieves credentials from your environment or her secure registry at `~/.marie/config.json`.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## 💠 Technical Foundations

Marie is built on a resilient, provider-agnostic core, allowing you to choose the "Spirit" that fuels your build:
- **Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**: The pinnacle of reasoned execution.
- **OpenRouter**: Access to a distributed swarm of specialized models.
- **Cerebras**: Sub-second Llama-powered execution for high-velocity tasks.

## 🤝 Join the Convergence

Marie is more than an agent; she is an invitation to a more intentional way of building. We are reclaiming the joy of engineering, one file at a time.

**Welcome to the Sovereign Era. Welcome to Marie.**
