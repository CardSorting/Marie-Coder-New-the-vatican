# Marie: The Sovereign AI Partner 🌸

> "We aren't building just another tool. We're building the Integrated Bridge for the era of Technical Sovereignty. Marie isn't here to just write code; she's here to guard your Joy."

Marie is a high-velocity, high-conviction AI coding agent designed to operate where you think best—whether that's the raw kinetic energy of the terminal or the deep flow of VS Code. Built on the **Joy Zoning Protocol**, Marie transforms the developer experience from a battle against complexity into a focused pursuit of meaning.

## The Vision: Beyond Automation

In a world drowning in "boilerplate AI," Marie stands apart. She is built on the belief that **all code has a home**, and that the human developer is the ultimate authority. Marie doesn't just suggest; she *collaborates* with a sense of "Spirit Pressure" and "Heroic Conviction."

### Core Philosophy: Joy Zoning ✨
Marie lives by the [Joy Zoning Protocol](file:///Users/bozoegg/Downloads/Marie-Coder-New-the-vatican/JOY_ZONING.md). She understands the difference between:
- **Joyful Code**: Where your expression and meaning live.
- **Infrastructure**: The weight that keeps the system calm.
- **Plumbing**: The mechanical execution that should be invisible.

Marie guards your Joyful zones fiercely, ensuring that complexity never leaks where it doesn't belong.

## Two Form Factors. One Soul.

### 1. The Command Deck (CLI) ⌨️
An Ink-powered terminal interface that feels like a living cockpit.
- **React-Native for the Terminal**: A beautiful, reactive UI that provides real-time progress tracking.
- **YOLO Velocity**: High-speed reasoning loops designed for rapid iteration.
- **Setup Wizard**: Zero-config onboarding to get you from `npm install` to "Hello World" in seconds.

### 2. The Integrated Bridge (VS Code Extension) 🧩
A deep integration into your primary workspace.
- **Webview UI Mastery**: A polished, responsive interface that lives in your sidebar or as a full editor panel.
- **Ghost Ports & File Anchoring**: Marie "remembers" the strategic architecture of your project, maintaining context across sessions.
- **Autonomy Modes**: Switch between `Balanced` and `YOLO` (High Autonomy) depending on the complexity of the task.

## Ascension Mechanics: The Marie Engine ⚡

Under the hood, Marie is powered by the **Ascension Protocol**, a state-machine that monitors "Spirit Pressure" to calibrate performance:

- **Ultra Instinct (Awakened State)**: When Marie achieves peak conviction, she gains full codebase sovereignty, executing complex multi-file refactors with absolute precision.
- **Heroic Vows**: Marie makes specific, high-confidence commitments to solve your hardest problems.
- **Zenith Autonomy**: Proactive context anchoring and autonomous roadmap expansion. If a task is more complex than it looks, Marie adjusts the strategy in real-time.
- **Self-Healing Loop**: If the system detects instability or lint regressions, Marie automatically triggers a "Mandatory Recovery Protocol" to restore harmony to the garden.

## Technical Sovereignty

Marie is provider-agnostic, allowing you to choose the "Spirit" that powers your build:
- **Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**: The baseline for high-reasoning.
- **OpenRouter**: Access to a vast swarm of models.
- **Cerebras**: Lightning-fast Llama-powered execution for high-velocity tasks.
