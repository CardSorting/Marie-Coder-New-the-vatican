> **Marie is a high-fidelity AI coding agent for developers who care about performance and architecture.**

Marie is an autonomous coding agent designed to transform chaotic AI-assisted development into structured, disciplined execution. She doesn’t just generate code — she enforces architectural integrity.

## 🏛 The Philosophy: Joy Zoning

Marie operates on a strict three-layer model to protect your cognitive flow. This isn't just a suggestion; it is the fundamental law of the ecosystem:

*   **Joyful Code ✨ (Domain)**: Pure logic. No adapters. No leakage. This is where your intent lives.
*   **Infrastructure 🏗️**: Coordination and integration. The layer that absorbs the world's complexity.
*   **Plumbing 🔧**: Execution mechanics and side effects. The reliable primitives that move the bytes.

> **Every file must have a home. Every layer must respect its boundary. Entropy must not rise.**

## 🛡 The Sentinel Engine

Marie includes a built-in architecture guardian. She watches the evolution of your codebase with absolute precision:

*   **High-fidelity import resolution** through real path analysis.
*   **Circular dependency detection** to prevent vertical rot.
*   **Semantic duplication detection** using token-normalized hashing.
*   **Weighted entropy scoring** to monitor system health.
*   **Monotonic "no regression" enforcement** for architectural rules.
*   **Persistent structural state tracking** across sessions.

**Architecture isn’t documentation. It’s enforced.**

## 🛰 Two Interfaces. One Intelligence.

Marie bridges the gap between the editor and the executor, providing a consistent intelligence across two primary interfaces:

### 1️⃣ CLI — The Command Deck
*A high-velocity terminal experience built for flow.*
*   **Real-time reasoning stream**: Watch the cognitive process as it unfolds.
*   **Structured multi-pass execution**: Planning, implementation, and verification in one loop.
*   **Surgical lint repair**: Automatic correction of mechanical errors.
*   **Architectural enforcement on write**: Preventing violations before they hit the disk.
*   **Provider-agnostic model support**: Switch engines without losing the mission.

### 2️⃣ VS Code — The Integrated Bridge
*Deep editor integration for strategic oversight.*
*   **Persistent architectural context**: Marie lives inside your project structure.
*   **Autonomy calibration**: From "Balanced" assistance to "High Autonomy" execution.
*   **Strategic multi-file transformations**: Coordinated changes across multiple modules.
*   **Visual Sentinel awareness**: Real-time feedback on Joy Zoning violations.

**Marie understands your codebase as a system — not a prompt.**

## ⚡ The Ascension Engine

Marie's execution model is state-driven, powered by the **Ascension Protocol**:

*   **Multi-pass structured planning**: Logic is derived before a single line is written.
*   **Self-correction loops**: Continuous validation against test suites and linters.
*   **Entropy-aware repair**: Fixing bugs without introducing architectural debt.
*   **Architecture-safe refactoring**: Moving code across zones with safety guarantees.

**High confidence enables high autonomy. Low confidence triggers surgical correction.**

## 🚀 Installation

Install Marie globally for universal sovereignty:

```bash
npm install -g @noorm/marie-cli
```

### Quick Start
1.  **Launch**: Simply type `marie` in your terminal.
2.  **Credentials**: 
    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
    ```
    *Or configure via persistent storage at `~/.marie/config.json`*

---

## 💠 Provider-Agnostic Core

Choose your engine. Marie adapts her execution style to the provider while maintaining the doctrine:
*   **Anthropic** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
*   **OpenRouter** (For the vast frontier of models)
*   **Cerebras** (For high-velocity inference)
*   **Any compatible endpoint**

## 🎯 Why Marie Exists

AI coding tools are powerful — but chaotic. Most tools optimize for *completion*; Marie optimizes for *system health*.

**Marie exists for developers who:**
*   Want structure, not spray-and-pray.
*   Care about separation of concerns.
*   Value long-term code health.
*   Refuse entropy creep.
*   Want autonomy without architectural collapse.

**Engineering is not just output. It’s discipline.**

## 🤝 Join the Convergence

Marie is an invitation to build intentionally. Not louder. Not faster. **Better.**

Welcome to Marie.
